I completed my PhD project at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and
successfully defended my dissertation at the Technical University Munich. In my
thesis, which is [available][thesis] at the online library of the University, I describe
the Monte Carlo radiation hydrodynamical technique, MCRH, which I have been
developing during the last years, establish its accuracy in a series of
standard test calculations and discuss its utility for astrophysical studies at
the example of radiation hydrodynamical processes in supernova Type Ia ejecta
and in line-driven hot-star winds. In particular, the investigation of hot-star
winds demonstrates the advantages of this Monte Carlo-based method to determine
self-consistently the radiative force exerted by the stellar radiation onto the
wind material in a multitude of atomic line interactions.

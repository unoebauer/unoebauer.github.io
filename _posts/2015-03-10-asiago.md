Together with Stefan Taubenberger and Emille Ishida, I've spent three nights at
the Observatory of Padova University in Asiago. We used the telescope on Cima
Ekar to classify and perform follow-up observations of a number of transient
objects. Some of our findings are summarized in the Atels [1][Atel1], [2][Atel2]
and [3][Atel3].

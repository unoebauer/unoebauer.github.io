We are happy to announce that we have just released a new major version of the
open-source Monte Carlo radiative transfer code [TARDIS][tardis_github].
Compared to version 1, this is a major step forwards and includes
many changes and improvements, particularly:

- the capability to handle isotopes and track their radioactive decays
- a new atomic data format, which is compatible with [CARSUS][carsus_github],
  our tool to aggregate atomic data from multiple sources
- the formal integral method of Lucy 1999 to generate noise-free spectra
  (currently limited to the downbranching line interaction scheme)
- OpenMP parallelisation of the main Monte Carlo procedures, allowing for a
  significant speed-up
- A modular plasma state treatment

You can find the current code version on [Github][tardis_github]. Also have a
look at the corresponding
[Zenodo record][tardis_zenodo] which gives you an idea
about our contributors.

As part of a collaboration lead by Alexandra Kozyreva and Raphael Hirschi, I
have contributed to the study of pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) models for
high-mass stars at relatively high metallicity. According to our stellar
evolution calculations, these models do not retain any hydrogen in the outer
layers at the point of explosion. Using detailed radiative transfer
calculations, we determined synthetic observables for pair-instability
supernovae occurring in such stars and found that their light curves are
relatively fast evolving. Thus, such events may be suitable candidates to
explain some superluminous supernovae. Additionally, an important part of this
study was the investigation associated with the light curve modelling. Here, we
focussed mainly on the consequences of using different radiative transfer
tools, relying on different opacity prescriptions and including the so-called
nickel-bubble effect. Our results are summarized in a paper which has just been
accepted for publication in MNRAS. A preprint may be found on the
[arXiv][Kozyreva2016] or on the [early access][Kozyreva2016mnras] system of
MNRAS.

An important step in the development of the Monte Carlo Radiation
Hydrodynamical approach MCRH has been completed. Having demonstrated the basic
operation of this method and an application to Type Ia supernova ejecta in a
[first paper][Noebauer2012], we have now successfully used MCRH in the context of
momentum-driven mass outflows from hot stars.

In particular, we demonstrated the utility of a Monte Carlo-based dynamical
approach for studying hot-star line-driven winds by determining the wind
structure and comparing it to results obtained with alternative methods. Here,
we focussed on variants of the original [CAK][CAK] approach and the Monte Carlo-based
hydrostatic approach of [MÃ¼ller & Vink 2008][Mueller2008]. The results of this study are
summarized in a [MNRAS paper][Noebauer2015].

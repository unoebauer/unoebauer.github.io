We have completed an important step towards our long-term goal of performing
cosmological distance measurements with type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP). This
work is lead by Christian Vogl who has significantly extended the capabilities
of our Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer code [TARDIS][tardislink]
[^footnote]. It is now capable of accurately performing spectral synthesis for
hydrogen-dominated supernovae. As a first demonstration, we have calculated a
new set of dilution factors, which can be used in the expanding photosphere
method (EPM) to determine distances to SNe IIP. We compare our results with the
two previously published sets of dilution factors, discuss possible origins for
their discrepancies and, for the first time, investigate the influence of
metallicity. Our findings are summarized in a paper, which has been accepted
for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. A preprint version can be found on
the [arxiv][vogl2018arxiv].

The TARDIS collaboration has been selected as a mentoring organization for the
"Google Summer of Code 2016" program and for ESA's counterpart "Summer of Code
in Space 2016".

![SoCiS 2016](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2015/sites/default/files/images/esalogo.png)

We will use these opportunities to advance the development of the TARDIS suite.
If you are interested in these programs or want to contribute, check out our
dedicated webpages for [GSoC][TardisGsoc] and [SoCiS][TardisSocis].

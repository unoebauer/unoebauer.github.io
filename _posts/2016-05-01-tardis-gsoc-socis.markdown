The TARDIS collaboration has been selected as a mentoring organization for the
"Google Summer of Code 2016" program and for ESA's counterpart "Summer of Code
in Space 2016".

We will use these opportunities to advance the development of
the TARDIS suite. If you are in these programs or want to contribute check out
our dedicated webpages for [GSoC][TardisGsoc] and [SoCiS][TardisSocis].

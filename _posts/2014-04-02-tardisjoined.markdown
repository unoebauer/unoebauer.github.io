I've joined the core development team of the open-source Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code [TARDIS][tardis]. With this method we aim to provide a fast, open
and easy-to-use tool to calculate synthetic spectra for supernovae,
particularly for Type Ia explosions. Ultimately, [TARDIS][tardis] should be
used as part of the [DALEK][dalek] suite to automatically fit observed
supernova spectra and derive the elemental composition and stratification of
the underlying ejecta!

As a result of my diploma thesis and the ensuing work as part of my PhD
project, the first paper on Monte Carlo radiation hydrodynamics has been
published. [There][noebauer2012ads], we outline the theoretical foundations of
our method, MCRH, and describe the involved numerical techniques in detail, in
particular the time-dependent Monte Carlo machinery and the Monte Carlo
estimator formalism. A series of successful test calculations is presented to
demonstrate the computational feasibility and physical accuracy of the basic
one-dimensional grey implementation of the method, featuring a grey radiative
transfer module. Among these, the determination of the structure of sub- and
supercritical radiative shocks provided the most demanding test. As the first
application to an astrophysical environment, we investigate the effect of the
radiation field generated by radioactive decays on the dynamics of type Ia
supernova ejecta. The radiation field induced changes on the order of 10 per
cent in the density stratification compared to a pure homologous evolution,
which are, as already found in previous studies, too weak to affect the
bolometric light curve.

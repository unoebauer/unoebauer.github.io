As in the last years, TARDIS will participate in the "Google Summer of Code
2017" program, this time under the umbrella of the [Pythons software
foundation][PSF]. We are looking for motivated and skilled students who are
interested in furthering the development of TARDIS. Check out our dedicated
[web page][TardisGsoc] or simply get in contact with us through our [gitter
channel][TardisGitter].
